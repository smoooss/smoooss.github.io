                                        <p>“You left me alone in the middle of the street,” cries Camila Gallardo to open her new single, “Un Poco Más De Frío”. We’re glad to see she’s back on two feet tonight to perform at W Santiago as part of Next Up, a new music series in partnership with Billboard that showcases the hottest artists from around the globe.</p>
                                        <p>Gallardo has already made waves in Latino pop after reaching the finals of The Voice Chile, and with chops like that, it won’t be long before the Anglo world takes notice.</p>
